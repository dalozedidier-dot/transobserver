# SOST Framework: System for Observing Systemic Transitions

**A methodological triptych (DD • DD-R • Equilibrium) for observing systemic transitions. Strictly descriptive, non-compensable, and non-predictive.**

> Guiding Principle: **Consistency precedes any interpretation.**

## 📜 The Triptych

This framework provides three distinct, complementary operators for the observational study of complex systems:

| Operator | Core Question | Temporal Logic | Aggregation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **DD (Coherence AI)** | Has a durable regime change occurred? | Initial, then rolling reference | Low quantile + break detection |
| **DD-R (Restoration)** | Is a dissipative restoration pattern detectable? | Fixed pre-crisis reference | Joint satisfaction of logical conditions |
| **Equilibrium (E)** | Is the current regime structurally compatible with a reference envelope? | Fixed pre-crisis reference | Non-compensable minimum |

## 🧠 Foundational Principles

*   **Ex-Ante Fixation**: All parameters, rules, and reference periods are defined before observation.
*   **Non-Compensability**: A critical deviation in one dimension cannot be offset by normality in others.
*   **Epistemic Suspension**: The framework implies **no causality, prediction, normativity, or evaluation**.
*   **Validity of Null**: Non-detection is a valid and meaningful output.
*   **Full Auditability**: Complete traceability of data, code, parameters, and any deviation.

## 🚀 Quick Start
